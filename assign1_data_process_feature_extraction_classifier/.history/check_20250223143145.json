STAFF took forever to address our problem, not KID friendly, pool dirty- and parking wow good luck going somewhere at night time and come back to the hotel to try to find a parking space THAT THEY CHARGE AN ADDITIONAL FEE FOR! (NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR OVERPRICED HOTEL STAY)\nWe thought by paying more we would get a good deal well this hotel is not the case!!\n$400 for a 2 night stay plus horrible customer service and a manager who never returned our call when we submitted the complain is not how you do business- They are giving SHERATON a horrible reputation- I guess they are managed by SHERATON but have their own \"policies\" and undesirable customer service.\nGreat time in San Diego but a nightmare of a hotel.\nDon't ever write reviews but this one was called for, if you can avoid this hotel do it.\n(Being a military family and moving from state to state we know about hotels and excellent customer service) \n(Oh yeah no free breakfast either)", "author": {"username": "Kh3RD", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "AB404BB664D653ECF79DE0E0867F6D34", "location": "Las Vegas, Nevada"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 80138, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 19, 2012", "id": 140716137, "via_mobile": false}
